Risk and Mitigation Strategy For any project of this scale, particularly in new regions, it is essential to anticipate potential risks and develop a proactive mitigation plan. SatSure recognizes that, while our technology and processes are robust, there are potential challenges that must be managed carefully. Below are the identified risks for the PoC with BASF and corresponding mitigation strategies to ensure successful project execution. 1. Data Gaps Due to Weather Conditions In Saskatchewan, frequent cloud cover during critical growing periods may result in interruptions to optical satellite data collection. This could impact the ability to monitor crop health and provide accurate acreage reports in real-time. 20", "page": 20, "type": "text"}, {"content": "critical growing periods may result in interruptions to optical satellite data collection.

SAR\u2019s ability to penetrate cloud cover ensures that data collection continues without interruption, even during adverse weather conditions. \u25cf Optical-SAR Fusion: Our Cygnus technology allows for the fusion of optical and SAR data to create continuous, cloud-free datasets for crop monitoring. This ensures that BASF receives consistent and uninterrupted insights throughout the growing season. 2. Limited Ground Truth Data Availability Given that this is a new region for SatSure, there may be challenges in gathering adequate ground truth data to validate satellite-based crop identification. Insufficient ground data can affect the accuracy of the machine learning models and delay the validation process. Mitigation Strategy: \u25cf Open Datasets, BASF internal data and Stats Canada: We will leverage open datasets, including historical data from Stats Canada, to supplement on-ground data. These datasets provide reliable historical crop acreage data, which can be used as a baseline for validating satellite outputs. 3.

Compliance with Data Privacy and Regulations Handling and processing data in a new region (Canada) may introduce challenges related to data privacy, security, and compliance with local regulations, such as data storage laws or handling sensitive agricultural information. Mitigation Strategy: \u25cf Compliance with Regional Regulations: SatSure will ensure full compliance with Canadian data privacy laws and agricultural regulations. We will work closely with legal experts and regulatory bodies to ensure that all data handling processes are aligned with local requirements. \u25cf Data Encryption and Security Protocols: SatSure will implement strong data encryption and security protocols to protect all data collected and processed during the PoC. This includes secure storage and transfer of data to prevent unauthorized access or breaches. 5. Seasonal Variability Affecting Data Quality Variability in weather conditions and crop growth patterns during different seasons may affect the consistency and quality of satellite data, impacting the accuracy of in-season monitoring.

This section provides a concise overview of Punjab's agriculturallandscape,settingthe stagefordetaileddiscussionsonproposedsolutionsandtheirpotentialimpact Problem statement The Government of Punjab faces significant challenges in accurately validating and compensating crop losses for farmers. The current system relies onself-reporteddata, which lacks scientific validation and can lead to inefficiencies and potential inaccuracies.Thekeyissuesare: 1. Inefficient Crop Loss Validation: Farmers currently declare their yield when selling produce at the APMC, but there is no scientific method to verify these claims. This manual system of validation is prone to inaccuracies and inconsistencies, making it difficultforthegovernmenttoaccuratelyassessandcompensateforcroplosses. 2. Lack of Real-Time Monitoring: There is no system in place to monitor crop health and yield potential in real-time at the plot level.

Need for Cadastral Maps: Accurate plot-level monitoring and compensation require access to cadastral maps. These maps are essential for identifying individual plots, tracking crop health, and ensuring that compensation is accurately targeted to the affectedareas. Implications \u25cf For Farmers: Delays and inaccuracies in compensation affect farmers' financial stability and their ability to invest in future crops. A more efficient system would provide timely support, reducing economic hardship and improving farmer livelihoods. \u25cf For the Government: An inefficient and inaccurate compensation process undermines the credibility of government initiatives and can lead to increased administrativecostsandpotentialforfraud. \u25cf For Agricultural Sustainability: Real-time monitoringandscientificvalidationcan help in better resource management, reducing over-reliance on groundwater and promotingsustainableagriculturalpractices.
